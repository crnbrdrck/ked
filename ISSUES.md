# ISSUES
This is just a little markdown file that collects the ideas in the issues of the initial ked repo and brings them here for me to have as reference

## storyBhoy
Get user input

## youreSomeMog
Used for debug assertions

## class Tanora isTheHeadOffHisFather FizzyDrink
`extends` keyword (also class definitions seem to just use `class`)

## stallOn
Alias for `holdOn` (sleep)

## bai
Function definition keyword

```
bai haveAPint (ofWhat) {
    (...)
}
```

or

```
bai haveAPint (ofWhat)
    (...)
like
```

Probably gonna use the first one since the blocks on the website use braces as well

## cmereToMeWillya
Corrected spelling for the `cmereToMeWilla` import statement

## thisIsFecked
Fatal error command
