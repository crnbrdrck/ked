[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/crnbrdrck/ked.svg)](https://github.com/crnbrdrck/ked/releases/latest)


The first scripting language of [The People's Republic of Cork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_\(city\)).

# Note
I went halfsies on a book about writing interpreters with my buddy Noah, so I'll be re-doing this project from scratch following that, and then `ked` should be even better :D

Also I'm in the process of writing my [GitHub pages theme](https://github.com/crnbrdrck/storm) which when finished will be used to generate some (hopefully) nice documentation for Ked v2 :D

## ked-lang Documentation
See the original [documentation](http://adam-lynch.github.io/ked/) showcasing the initial design of the language.

There will also be documentation more akin to a reference available sometime (not right now basically) at https://crnbrdrck.xyz/ked.

## But Why?
This interpreter is being built by me ([crnbrdrck](https://github.com/crnbrdrck)), in the wonderful Crystal Programming Language, by following [this tutorial](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)

I'm doing this for a few reasons;
1. I wanted to learn how interpreters function
2. I wanted another project to do in Crystal
3. I've known about Ked for a while and always assumed it was an actual programming language so I wanted to make it real
4. For the fun of it

## Installation

1. Ensure that *Crystal* is installed on your machine: https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/
2. Clone this repo from the master branch: `git clone git@github.com:crnbrdrck/ked.git`
3. Build the binary: `make`
    - The binary will be saved to `./bin/`
4. (Optionally) Install the binary to your path: `sudo make install`

To remove, simply do `sudo make clean` which will clean up any directories and files made by the install process

## Usage

```
Usage:
  ked [options] feen.ked - Run the script called 'feen.ked'

  Options:
    -d, --debug                      Print the status of the global variable scope after running the script
    -h, --help                       Show this help message
    -v, --version                    Print version information
```

- `ked feen.ked` - Run the script named 'feen.ked'
- `ked -d feen.ked` - Same as above but also prints the current state of the interpreter's global variable state table to stdout
- `ked -v` - Check the current version of `ked` installed

## Dev Roadmap
A little way of checking the progress of the development of the `ked` programming language

### Interpreter Tutorial

### Implemented Features
This is an ever growing list of the current features supported in the `ked` language.
If this list grows too big I'll probably group things together to give it a semblance of structure

***NOTE**: Anything in the list below marked with an asterisk was something not in the original design doc and is open to debate*

- `remember` statements: Assigning variables
- `plus` operator: Addition of numbers
- `awayFrom` operator: Subtraction of numbers
- `times` operator: Multiplication of numbers
- `into` operator: Division of numbers
    - `easyInto` operator: Integer division *
- Unary operators: `+` or `-` signs in front of numbers
- `Â£`: comment *
- `bai`: function definition
    - NOTE: Function definitions are parsable but currently do nothing
    - ANOTHER NOTE: Parameter lists are now parsable
- `saysI`: printing to stdout (called *The Echo* in `ked`)

For more info, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed and when
