![Travis Master Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/crnbrdrck/ked/master.svg)

The first scripting language of [The People's Republic of Cork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_\(city\)).

See the [documentation](http://adam-lynch.github.io/ked/) (maintained at the [gh-pages](https://github.com/adam-lynch/ked/tree/gh-pages) branch).

This interpreter is being built by [crnbrdrck](https://github.com/crnbrdrck) in the wonderful Crystal Programming Language by following [this tutorial](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/)

I'm doing this for a few reasons;
1. I wanted to learn how interpreters function
2. I wanted another project to do in Crystal
3. I've known about Ked for a while and always assumed it was an actual programming language so I wanted to make it real
4. For the fun of it

## Progress Report

Currently after completing part 8 of the tutorial.
Part 9 begins talking about parsing an entire Pascal file, so I imagine it will be from this point on that the Ked-lang interpreter will start to take shape of its own.
Stay tuned ;)
