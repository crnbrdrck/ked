# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0
- Moved to a new tutorial to rewrite the interpreter in hopefully a better way
    - Added new way of handling the lexing process
    - Added a simple REPL environment that lexes stdin

## 0.1.4
- Added function parameter handling using nested scope tables
    - Functions **still** do not work though, but I'll get there someday
- More importantly, `saysI` statements are now understood by the interpreter, so you can now print your variables!

## 0.1.3
- Added function definitions using the `bai` keyword
    - They currently are skipped by the language and do nothing however
- Resolved an issue where integer style number variables are being parsed like float style numbers

## 0.1.2
- Added a Symbol Table which gets built up from the AST generated from the script
    - Symbol Table keeps track of defined symbols, removing the checks from the interpreter's global_scope
- Collapsed the INTEGER and REAL token types into a single NUMBER type, which matches up with the design spec
- Updated code slightly to work with Crystal 0.25

## 0.1.1
- Added handling for integer division and commenting

## 0.1.0
- The interpreter can finally interpret programs so that's nice
- Assignment statements (`remember â‚¬x = 1 like`) now work and variable information is currently stored in a Hash
    - This Hash needs to be replaced with an ADT at a later date
- Moving the repo to using `develop` and `master` branch workflow
